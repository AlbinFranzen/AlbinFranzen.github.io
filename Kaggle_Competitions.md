title: Kaggle Competitions

**Competition results** 

I enter kaggle competitions to practice my current skills and learn about new bleeding-edge models and preprocessing techniques. A minor drawback with kaggle is that the input data is often presented in clean structured forms which is unrealistic compared to real-world data gathering and preparation. Therefore I use kaggle as a supplement to my personal projects and to improve my modelling techniques rather than using it as a standalone machine learning basis. Here you can see some of my kaggle results:

- Titanic
- MNIST

**Results from already closed competitions**

I occasionally enter competitions which have already passed their deadlines to practice my machine learning workflow. Here are some results from what my submissions would have recieved had they been submitted in time:

- foo
