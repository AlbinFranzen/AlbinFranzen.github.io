Hello! I am an aspiring data analyst currently studying engineering mathematics with a specialisation in statistics at Lund university. I graduated high school where I studied natural sciences in 2020 and afterwards I was conscripted for a one year military service as a squad leader of mobile ground-based radar team in the Swedish Armed Forces. I am interested in statistics and data analysis and aim to pursue a career in the future. 

My prior work experience consists primarily of working as a tennis coach for varied levels from beginner to advanced competitive players. Tennis is one of my greatest hobbies which I have played since I was very young. Apart from tennis I am also interested in calisthenics/bodyweight training and speedcubing.
