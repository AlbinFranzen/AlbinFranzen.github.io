Hello! I am a young aspiring AI enthusiast who graduated high school of natural sciences 2020 in Helsingborg, Sweden where I currently live. Afterwards I was conscripted for a one year military service as a squad leader and mobile ground-based radar operater in the Swedish Armed Forces where I improved my collaboration and leadership skills. Currently I am studying my first year of undergraduate physics at Lunds University in which I plan to participate in their machine learning masters in the future. 

My prior work experience consists primarily of working as a tennis coach for varied levels from beginner to advanced competitive players. Tennis is one of my greatest hobbies which I have played since I was very young. Apart from tennis I am also interested in elite calisthenics/bodyweight training and speedcubing.
